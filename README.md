# The-Quest-to-Find-the-Most-Popular-Games-on-Twitch
Using R, I use a data set from Twitch based on information from 2016-2021 to find the most popular games on Twitch. Popular amongst who though? Both viewers and streamers. So I use some magic in R's ggplot, dplyr, and stringr to pull out information on which games are go-to's of streaming. I also offer some explanations for their popularity and mostly neat little graphs to aid in the quest.

Update 5/4/22: Now with Tableau graphs!
